    <p>A dish beloved by a whole world. You simply cant eat less than 10 and fell happy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups mushrooms, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>7 potatoes, peeled and boiled</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ (15 ounce) containers farmer's cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        </ul><br>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare filling: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and mushrooms in hot oil until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. </li><br>
            <li>Pass potatoes and farmer's cheese separately through a food grinder or food processor; place both in a large bowl. Add onion-mushroom mixture, sour cream, salt, and pepper; mix until well combined and set filling aside. </li><br>
            <li>Make dough: Place flour on a clean work surface and form a well in the center. Crack eggs into the well. Add butter and a few tablespoons warm water. Mix with your hands, gradually adding more warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as you go. Knead until dough is soft and smooth, adding more flour to the work surface as needed. </li><br>
            <li>Roll out 1/4 of the dough to an 1/8-inch thickness. Use a glass or round cookie cutter to cut out circles, saving any excess dough for your next batch. Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and pinch edges together to seal. Cover pierogi with a clean dish towel and repeat with remaining dough and filling. </li><br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Cook pierogi in batches, about 20 at a time, in boiling water until they float to the surface, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a strainer to drain.</li><br>
        </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>You can use cream cheese or ricotta instead of farmer's cheese. 
            Polish white cheese or Russian tvorog (curd cheese) is used in Poland.<br>
            You may be able to find them at a Polish market. You can freeze any extra uncooked pierogi.</p>
