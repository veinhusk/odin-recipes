        <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 175°C</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add kielbasa and bacon; cook and
            stir until bacon has rendered its fat and sausage is lightly
            browned. Use a slotted spoon to remove the meat and transfer to a
            large casserole or Dutch oven
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Coat cubes of pork lightly with flour and fry them in the bacon
            drippings over medium-high heat until golden brown. Use a slotted
            spoon to transfer pork to the casserole.Add cabbage, carrots, onion,
            fresh mushrooms, and garlic. Add in sauerkraut. Reduce heat to
            medium; cook and stir until carrots are soft, about 10 minutes. Do
            not let the vegetables brown
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Deglaze the pan by pouring in red wine and stirring to loosen all of
            the bits of food and flour that are stuck to the bottom. Season with
            bay leaf, paprika, basil, marjoram, salt, pepper, caraway seed, and
            cayenne; cook for 1 minute
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Mix in beef stock, tomatoes, dried mushrooms, tomato paste, hot
            pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Heat through just until
            boiling. Pour vegetables and all of the liquid into the casserole
            dish with meat. Cover with a lid
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until meat is very tender, 2½ to 3 hours
          </li>
          <br />
        </ol>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
          Best served with fresh bread. It preserves very well and usually
          tastes better reheated.
