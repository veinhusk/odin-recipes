# odin-recipes

This project is a culmination of The Odin's Project 'Foundation Course' series.
Up to this point most of the course were theoretical.
The subjects were broad including many mindset advices, the importance of git, or basics of understanding the web structure.


While web structure became less of the mystery it unlocked more understanding into the core building blocks of web.
HTML, CSS and JS, however in this first part the main focus was HTML.
And this is what's this project is about, making a simple HTML Recipies website and getting used to git commands and problem solving.

And most importantly how to write proper git commit messages.
